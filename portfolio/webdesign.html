<p><b>Web design is the code and work that goes into the frontend of websites. Web design is what you see when you open something like google.com or yahoo.com. You could also say that it also involves designing how everything works, but that's also controlled by the code through HTML and CSS. Web design also works with languages like JavaScript too.</b></p>
