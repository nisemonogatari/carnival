<xmp>XMP is kind of like listing... I think? The text above cuts off unless you expand the window >:(
wait... it does that for XMP too!!</xmp>

<h2>Address element</h2>

<p>Address makes the text italicized. It's pretty cool.</p>
<address>it doesn't support line breaks though. i like being able to do line breaks :(
if you look in the source, I actually did make a line break. don't call me a liar!</address>
<address>I ended up adding another one...</address>

<dir>Stuff I need to do to this site
	<li>Make it look a lot better
	<li>learn how to add pictures
	<li>I actually don't know</dir>
